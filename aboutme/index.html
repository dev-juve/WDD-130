        <h2>Juvenson ELIZAIRE</h2>
        
        <p> My name is Juvenson ELIZAIRE, and I am thrilled to be a part of this course.
          I am originally from Haiti, currently residing in Port-au-Prince. I am in my mid-twenties and am single.
          I find great joy in reading, working out to stay active, exploring new places through travel, and immersing myself in
          the magic of music.<br><br>  
          
          I am deeply passionate about software development, which has led me to pursue a degree in the field at Brigham Young
          University - Idaho (BYU Idaho). What excites me most about this academic journey is the incredible sense of community at
          BYU Idaho. I've never felt alone here. There is always a friendly face or helpful online resource available when I need
          support.<br><br>
        
          I firmly believe in the power of collaboration and mutual learning. I am here not only to expand my knowledge but also
          to share my experiences and insights with all of you. I am genuinely looking forward to getting to know each one of you,
          learning together, and building meaningful connections throughout this semester.<br><br>  
          
          I want to extend my best wishes to each of you for a successful and fulfilling semester. Let's embark on this
          educational adventure together, and I am eager to engage in the enriching discussions and experiences that lie ahead.
